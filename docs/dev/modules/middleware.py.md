# Classes

CacheControlMiddleware(django.utils.deprecation.MiddlewareMixin)
```

Sets the Cache-Control s-maxage header on responses


## CurrentRequestContext

```
CurrentRequestContext(builtins.object)
```

Middleware that sets the current request context.

This allows access to the current request from anywhere.

Call self as a function.

---
#### \__init__

## HttpResponseUnauthorized

```
HttpResponseUnauthorized(django.http.response.HttpResponse)
```

An HTTP response class with a string as content.

This content can be read, appended to, or replaced.


## PDBCommonMiddleware

```
PDBCommonMiddleware(django.middleware.common.CommonMiddleware)
```

"Common" middleware for taking care of some basic operations:

    - Forbid access to User-Agents in settings.DISALLOWED_USER_AGENTS

    - URL rewriting: Based on the APPEND_SLASH and PREPEND_WWW settings,
      append missing slashes and/or prepends missing "www."s.

        - If APPEND_SLASH is set and the initial URL doesn't end with a
          slash, and it is not found in urlpatterns, form a new URL by
          appending a slash at the end. If this new URL is found in
          urlpatterns, return an HTTP redirect to this new URL; otherwise
          process the initial URL as usual.

      This behavior can be customized by subclassing CommonMiddleware and
      overriding the response_redirect_class attribute.


### Methods

#### process_request
`def process_request(self, request)`

Check for denied User-Agents and rewrite the URL based on
settings.APPEND_SLASH and settings.PREPEND_WWW

---

## PDBPermissionMiddleware

#### response_unauthorized
`def response_unauthorized(self, request, status=None, message=None)`

Return a Unauthorized response.

---

## PDBSessionMiddleware

```
PDBSessionMiddleware(django.contrib.sessions.middleware.SessionMiddleware)
```

As PeeringDB gets a lot of repeated anonymous requests that do not
store and re-use session cookies this lead to substantial amount of junk
django session objects.

It was decided in #1205 that new django sessions are only to be established
On the login and registration processes.


### Methods

#### process_response
`def process_response(self, request, response)`

If request.session was modified, or if the configuration is to save the
session every time, save the changes and set a session cookie or delete
the session cookie if the session has been emptied.

---

## RedisNegativeCacheMiddleware

```
RedisNegativeCacheMiddleware(django.utils.deprecation.MiddlewareMixin)
```
