# peeringdb_server.ixf

IX-F importer implementation.

Handles import of ix-f feeds, creation of suggestions for networks and exchanges
to follow.

Handles notifications of networks and exchanges as part of that process.

A substantial part of the import logic is handled through models.py::IXFMemberData

# Classes
---

## MultipleVlansInPrefix

```
MultipleVlansInPrefix(builtins.ValueError)
```

This error is raised when an ix-f export contains
multiple vlan ids for the prefixes defined in the processed ixlan.

Since peeringdb treats each vlan as it's own exchange this currently
is not a compatible setup for import (see #889).
