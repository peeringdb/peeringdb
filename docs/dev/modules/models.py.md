# peeringdb_server.models

Django model definitions (database schema).

## django-peeringdb

peeringdb_server uses the abstract models from django-peeringdb.

Often, it makes the most sense for a field to be added to the abstraction
in django-peeringdb, so it can be available for people using local snapshots of the databases.

Generally speaking, if the field is to be added to the REST API output,
it should be added through django-peeringdb.

Fields to facilitate internal operations of peeringdb on the other hand, DO NOT need to be added to django-peeringdb.

## migrations

For concrete models, django-peeringdb and peeringdb_server maintain separate model migrations.

When adding new fields to django-peeringdb make sure migration files for the schema changes exist in both places.

Please open a merge request in peeringdb/django-peeringdb for the field addition as well.

# Functions
---

## default_time_e
`def default_time_e()`

Returns datetime set to today with a time of 23:59:59.

---
## default_time_s
`def default_time_s()`

Returns datetime set to today with a time of 00:00:00.

---
## is_suggested
`def is_suggested(entity)`

Check if the network, facility or exchange is a suggested
entity (is it a memeber of the organization designated to
hold suggested entities).

---
## validate_PUT_ownership
`def validate_PUT_ownership(permission_holder, instance, data, fields)`

Helper function that checks if a user or API key has write perms to
the instance provided as well as write perms to any
child instances specified by fields as they exist on
the model and in data.

Example:

validate_PUT_ownership(
  request.user,
  network_contact,
  {
    "network": 123,
    ...
  },
  ["network"]
)

will check that the user has write perms to

  1. <NetworkContact> network_contact
  2. <Network> network_contact.network
  3. <Network> network(id=123)

if any fail the permission check False is returned.

### Methods

#### save
`def save(self, *args, **kwargs)`

Save the current instance. Override this in a subclass if you want to

the affiliation request themselves.

Please look at signals.py for the logic of notification as
well as deriving the organization from the ASN during creation.

## ValidationErrorEncoder

```
ValidationErrorEncoder(json.encoder.JSONEncoder)
```

Extensible JSON <https://json.org> encoder for Python data structures.

Supports the following objects and types by default:

+-------------------+---------------+
| Python            | JSON          |
+===================+===============+
| dict              | object        |
+-------------------+---------------+
| list, tuple       | array         |
+-------------------+---------------+
| str               | string        |
+-------------------+---------------+
| int, float        | number        |
+-------------------+---------------+
| True              | true          |
+-------------------+---------------+
| False             | false         |
+-------------------+---------------+
| None              | null          |
+-------------------+---------------+

To extend this to recognize other objects, subclass and implement a
``.default()`` method with another method that returns a serializable
object for ``o`` if possible, otherwise it should call the superclass
implementation (to raise ``TypeError``).


### Methods

#### default
`def default(self, obj)`

Implement this method in a subclass such that it returns
a serializable object for ``o``, or calls the base implementation
(to raise a ``TypeError``).

For example, to support arbitrary iterators, you could
implement default like this::

    def default(self, o):
        try:
            iterable = iter(o)
        except TypeError:
            pass
        else:
            return list(iterable)
        # Let the base class default method raise the TypeError
        return super().default(o)

---

## VerificationQueueItem

```
VerificationQueueItem(peeringdb_server.models.StripFieldMixin)

- approve_admin_url (`@property`): Return admin url for approval of the verification queue item.
- deny_admin_url (`@property`): Return admin url for denial of the verification queue item.
