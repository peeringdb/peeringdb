# peeringdb_server.serializers

REST API Serializer definitions.
REST API POST / PUT data validators.

New serializers should extend ModelSerializer class, which is a custom extension
of django-rest-framework's ModelSerializer.

Custom ModelSerializer implements logic for the expansion of relationships driven by the `depth` url parameter. The depth parameter indicates how many objects to recurse into.

Special api filtering implementation should be done through the `prepare_query`
method.

# Functions
---

## nested
`def nested(serializer, exclude=[], getter=None, through=None, **kwargs)`

Use this function to create nested serializer fields. Making
depth work otherwise while fetching related lists via handlref remains a mystery.

---
## queryable_field_xl
`def queryable_field_xl(fld)`

Translate <fld>_id into <fld> and also translate fac and net queries into "facility"
and "network" queries.

FIXME: should be renamed on model schema.

---
# Classes
---

## ASSetSerializer

```
ASSetSerializer(peeringdb_server.serializers.NetworkSerializer)
```

Serializer for peeringdb_server.models.Network

Possible realtionship queries:
  - org_id, handled by serializer
  - ix_id, handled by prepare_query
  - ixlan_id, handled by prepare_query
  - netfac_id, handled by prepare_query
  - fac_id, handled by prepare_query


## AddressSerializer

```
AddressSerializer(rest_framework.serializers.ModelSerializer)
```

A `ModelSerializer` is just a regular `Serializer`, except that:

* A set of default fields are automatically populated.
* A set of default validators are automatically populated.
* Default `.create()` and `.update()` implementations are provided.

The process of automatically determining a set of serializer fields
based on the model fields is reasonably complex, but you almost certainly
don't need to dig into the implementation.

If the `ModelSerializer` class *doesn't* generate the set of fields that
you need you should either declare the extra/differing fields explicitly on
the serializer class, or simply use a `Serializer` class.


## AsnRdapValidator

```
AsnRdapValidator(builtins.object)
```

to normalize the location against the Google Maps Geocode API
and resave the model instance with normalized address fields.

Can only be used if the model includes the GeocodeBaseMixin.


### Methods

#### _add_meta_information
`def _add_meta_information(self, metadata)`

Adds a dictionary of metadata to the "meta" field of the API
request, so that it ends up in the API response.

---
#### _geosync_information_present
`def _geosync_information_present(self, instance, validated_data)`

Determine if there is enough address information
to necessitate a geosync attempt.

---

the address (including address not found), a warning is returned in
the "meta" field of the response and null the latitude and
longitude on the instance.

---
#### needs_address_suggestion
`def needs_address_suggestion(self, suggested_address, instance)`

from the address the user provided, we return True to signal
a address suggestion should be provided to the user.

---
#### update
`def update(self, instance, validated_data)`

update the model first
and then normalize the geofields.

## ModelSerializer

```
ModelSerializer(rest_framework.serializers.ModelSerializer)
```

ModelSerializer that provides DB API with custom params.

Main problem with doing field ops here is data is already fetched, so while
it's fine for single columns, it doesn't help on speed for fk relationships.
However data is not yet serialized so there may be some gain.

Using custom method fields to introspect doesn't work at all, because
they're not called until they're serialized, and then are called once per row,

for example
test_depth = serializers.SerializerMethodField('check_for_fk')
def check_for_fk(self, obj):
    print "check ", type(obj)

class Meta:
    fields = [
        'test_depth',
        ...

Best bet so far looks like overloading the single object GET in the model
view set, and adding on the relationships, but need to GET to GET the fields
defined yet not included in the query, may have to rewrite the base class,
which would mean talking to the dev and committing back or we'll have this problem
every update.

After testing, the time is all in serialization and transfer, so culling
related here should be fine.

arg[0] is a queryset, but seems to have already been evaluated

Addition Query arguments:
`fields` comma separated list of only fields to display

    could cull the default list down quite a bit by default and make people ask explicitly for them
    self.Meta.default_fields, but I'm not sure it matters, more testing
