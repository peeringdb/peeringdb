# peeringdb_server.permissions

Utilities for permission handling.

Permission logic is handled through django-grainy.

API key auth is handled through djangorestframework-api-key.

Determine permission holder from request (api key or user).

Read only user api key handling.

Censor API output data according to permissions using grainy Applicators.
