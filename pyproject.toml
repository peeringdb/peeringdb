# FIXME: django-oauth-toolkit needs to be locked to 1.6.1 because it introduced
# api breaking changes that were then reverted in 1.6.2 - in order to upgrade
# we need to wait for them to re-introduce the changes or adapt our code to
# the reversion
#
# django-oauth-toolkit 2.0.0 is ready but also introduces additional BREAKING changes that may
# need to be communicated to users, such as unreversible hashing of their current client
