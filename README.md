[PeeringDB](https://peeringdb.com/) provides a scalable way to publish
interconnection related information for tens of thousands of network
operators. Over the years, more and more organisations have built
integrations to streamline their interconnection processes.

We are pleased to announce PeeringDB's source code is now publicly
available under a BSD 2-Clause license.

We anticipate that work considered to be "low hanging fruit" could be
taken on by volunteers, and we expect that open sourcing the platform
makes it easier for third parties to participate in bidding for new
features specified by the Product Committee.

Developers in the community may now fork the code, [create a container for development and testing](docs/container.md), and submit pull requests.
